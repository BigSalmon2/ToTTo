# ToTTo
ToTTo is a dataset for the controlled table-to-text generation dataset comprising of over 100,000 examples. For each example, given a table and set of highlighted cells as input, the goal is to produce a one sentence description. ToTTo is unique both in task design as well as annotation process. In particular, during the dataset creation process, tables from English Wikipedia are matched with (noisy) descriptions. Each table cell mentioned in the description is highlighted and the descriptions are iteratively cleaned and corrected to faithfully reflect the content of the highlighted cells.
